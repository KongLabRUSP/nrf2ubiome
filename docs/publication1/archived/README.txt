Submit to Molecular Carcinogenesis

From Dr. Kong:
As indicated in my previous email, we will be better off to combine the LPS/metabolome
for PEITC into ONE paper, to make it a much stronger paper to submit to Molecular Carcinogenesis.

Yes, I like the idea to  combine all of them, PEITC and cranberry, Nrf2 KO, DSS, microbiome 
and metabolome, into one big paper and send to higher impact factor journal such as MNFR or JNB?
That will be more interesting in many comparisons, such as between PEITC vs cranberry etc

Please add in the Background, the DSS model, and cranberry, if these were not included in the original manuscript. 
Also, add the methods such as metabolome from Chi Chen sent previously. And then add in the results section, 
the DSS results and cranberry results. Expand a little bit on the conclusion.  
Please take the next week or two to finalize this.
